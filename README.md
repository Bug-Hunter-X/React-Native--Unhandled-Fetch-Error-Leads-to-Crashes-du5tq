# React Native Unhandled Fetch Error

This repository demonstrates a common error in React Native applications: insufficient error handling when fetching data asynchronously.  The `bug.js` file shows a component that fetches data but lacks proper handling of potential errors during the fetch process. This can lead to unexpected behavior or crashes if the fetch request fails.

The solution, demonstrated in `bugSolution.js`, adds more robust error handling to gracefully manage failures and prevent crashes. This involves providing feedback to the user and preventing the component from attempting to access data that might be `null` or `undefined`.

## How to Reproduce

1. Clone this repository.
2. Run `npm install` or `yarn install` to install dependencies.
3. Run the app using a React Native emulator or device. Note that you'll need to provide a valid URL for the fetch request (or modify the URL to simulate failure)
4. Observe the behavior when the fetch request succeeds and when it fails. Compare the behavior to understand the impact of unhandled errors.
